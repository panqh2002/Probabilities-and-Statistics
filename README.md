# Probabilities-and-Statistics
Studying for the coming Qiu Contest in 2024, hoping to get a winner award in Probabilities and Statistics  
 In this repository, I share several recommended books and the previous questions.  
And I deicided to update my studying conditon here wishing I make progress every day!
